            "Avengers: Endgame" is probably one of Marvel's best movies yet. It starts out with Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Nebula stranded in space. He sends out a distress call, and Captain Marvel (Who, I admit, is too overpowered) saves them both. They soon return to Earth, where the remaining Avengers, are there. They later find out that Thanos is using the infinity stones to destroy the tones themselves. After a little talking, Thor, who is angry since half of the universe is dead because he didn't go for the head, has enough of Thanos' voice and abruptly chops off his head. 5 years later, all the Avengers are split up and depressed. Suddenly, though, Ant Man gets released from the quantum realm by accident. He gets excited and tells the Avengers that they can do time travel since the quantum realm is a dimension that can slow or speed up time. He eventually gets all  the Avengers to get the Avengers to come except one. Thor. They travel to New Asgard and find that his home is invaded by a fat, drunk man, who is Thor himself. They eventually convince him to join them by saying "there's wine on the ship." Anyways, they fired up the time portal, and off they went. They all succeeded in getting all the stones back, except for Nebula's team. She get's spotted by the 2012 Thanos, Gamora, and Nebula herself from the past. Thanos finds out his future and launches an attack on the Avengers, who have all 6 infinity stones. Eventually, the Avengers snap before Thanos comes. It takes a while, but eventually, Thanos comes. Gamora has small talk with Nebula from the future, and Nebula tells everthing that has happened between 2012 through present day. She stops the Nebula from 2012, who has a desire to impress Thanos, and shoot her. Thanos brings an army of soldiers and ships, who have many more monsters inside, but then all the Avengers that have been snapped away by Thanos in INFINITY WAR come back from the Quantum Realm. They have an epic fight, and the makeshift infinity Gauntlet falls from the hand of Thanos. it becomes like a football game after Peter Parker picks it up and plays keep away. The movie comes to a climatic end when Tony Stark gets the gauntlet and snaps away thanos and his army, which kills him. Then, after Tony's funeral, Captain America puts the stones away. When comes back, he is very old, since while in the quantum realm, he met the love of his life.Overall, this was a really good movie with a lot of juicy details and battles, using the topic of time travel, and having the same old general humor that the Marvel characters have.
