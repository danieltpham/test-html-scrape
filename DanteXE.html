            22 movie has led to this garbage. Thank you MARVEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU FKING IDIOTS!I have Spider-Man tattoo in my whole arm, you know i'm a fanboy but this. this is just pure garbage movie.First of all, it's not even half of Infinity War.This movie is basically most expensive fan fiction movie of all time. All of the movie is just Star-Lord's Thanos slapping cheap. All of the motives, events everything is that much ridiculous.1) You fcking shove Captain Marvel into MCU before this. She is absent from movie. What the hell you forced her to MCU at this point. You don't need her.2)Everyone waiting for Hulk's revenge, but oh no! He is peacefull and powerless. It's not the same Hulk, he is shorter, smaller, and not powerfull as old one.3) You make Thor OP at IW, but oh no! He is fcking a loser now. He can't even hit a punch on Thanos. Everyone waiting for Thor but you wasted him. He killed Thanos with full Gauntlet but now he cant even hit stoneless Thanos. Bravo Marvel, f*cking Bravo.4)Some things should stay in comic pages. Comic has lots of ridiculous things. Captain America and Mjolnir is one of them. It's not working like that, that hammer won't go who ever calling it. You can't stay consistent with your rules. Also that idiot is not worthy, after everything happened Civil War and Infinity War is because of him. He is the biggest douchebag in MCU. Worthless bastard.5)Ant-Man's come back... All of the universe saved because of a rat. If there isn't a rat there all of the universe is just fked up...6)14 million possibilities and 1 success. It is really this one? If you saying this, i will look for all of the possibilities. You should make a ending with no other possiblities. But I can assure you the is a possibility there is Thor is not an idiot or Captain Marvel is actually usefull. Or Doctor Strange is just fking do something other than holding water... Marvel, you are just bunch of idiots you know. Hell, there should be a timeline that Thor hits Thanos' head or Ironman tooks stones and just runs, there is no need to use those but they should kill him you know, so he is used the stones... Captain Marvel can destroy that thrash can gauntlet with power, why the hell she didn't do that? Also why the fk Thanos did go to Nidavellir for Gauntlet? Stark can do this with Aluminium not even vibranium you know? And Hulk cried 5 hourse after stones but Ironman just talked with no problem... This movie is just **** garbage.
