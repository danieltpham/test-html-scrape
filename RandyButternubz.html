            All in all I thought it was good movie, to sum it up in one word bittersweet. There were a lot of plot holes but they were ignorable for the most part. I really liked how they used captain marvel, and that Tony and Thor got some revenge. I thought what they did with Thor was abysmal, they could of handled that so much better than making him the dude. Professor Hulk was cool, but Hawkeye's Ronan story arc stole the show for the most part. The end war was visually stunning and action packed. the 3 on 1 scene with cap, tony and thor was so awesome. This was a great ending to a decade of movies, everyone was tied in at the end, that kind of story telling and character development is extremely impressive. I think that is the end of my MCU experience as they transition into phase 4 I think I have had enough. Thanks Marvel for over a decade of bringing the comics to life.4
