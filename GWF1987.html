            11 years and 20+ movies and it all builds up to a meh of a movie.It was average. The good parts were good, the bad parts were really, really badJokes were excessive in what should have been a dark film.Ant-man coming back after 5 years shows Marvel Studios don't even care about their own continuity. If 5 years in real life is only 5 hours in the Quantum Realm why was Janet old in Ant-man and the Wasp? People still mock the Martha scene from BvS but let's be honest, the "Cap freezes up and stops fighting when someone mentions Bucky" nonsense is way worse than the Martha scene. It's used AGAIN in this one. It's ridiculous.They borrow from Dragon Ball Z for how time travel works, that way they can mess with time with no repercussions.Widow's death was emotional manipulation, and ultimately felt forgettable after the fact. Tony's death was the only really good part of the movie because it felt like the right way to end it, especially knowing how the MCu started with Tony being a selfish playboy.Steve somehow can go back in time and live out his life and be old in the present, with no changes to the current timeline? It's so stupid. And he gives the Shield to Falcon? Ugh. They really are going full SJW with future movies, aren't they? Forgettable movie. It was average at best and as usual the critics show how biased they truly are where they call this movie "Once in a generation" when it's just another MCU movie that is meh at best. Rotten Tomatoes also shows the bias used to protect the scores of MCU movies (not just them deleting negative audience ratings for Captain Marvel but legit critic score they manipulate). One critic gave the film a 2/5 but their review was labelled as "Fresh". Mind you, a 2.5 for BvS was considered "Rotten". Amazing how that works, isn't it? How a 2/5 is Fresh but a higher rating is somehow rotten for a non-Disney comic movie? But there's no bias (sarcasm)They further ruin Hulk and Thor, and seeing Hulk dab had me ready to walk out of the theater. I gave this a higher score intially but remembering the dab brought my score down from a 4 to a 3Seeing Captain Marvel easily destroying a full powered Thanos and shrugging off his blow like it was nothing shows how big of a Mary Sue she's really going to be in future films. And I honestly believe before hey did a bunch of reshoots a few months ago she beat Thanos and saved the day, and after seeing reaction to her character and Larson's comments against a large chunk of their potential audience they changed it to Tony stopping Thanos with the stones to keep from alienating more of their fans with that shoehorned in character.This should have been the end of the MCU. But the franchise prints money because of people like the guy who made headlines for seeing Captain Marvel 116 times and the guy last year who saw Infinity War over 100 times in theaters. So bad to average movies will continue to dominate box offices, prompting other studios to follow suit, meaning the days of good filmmaking will continue to fade into memory
