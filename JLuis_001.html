            22 films and 11 years later, Avengers: Endgame is the end of an incredible stage in film within the blockbuster branch.You can hate it but definitely you must recognize that what Marvel Studios built with this franchise is something that will hardly be seen again in this industry.Superhero films existed before Iron Man and the MCU but the ambition of this project completely surpassed everything else.That the audience that perhaps didn’t care about comic books at all was so involved with this saga and followed it until the end says a lot. The tears that the people next to me spilled in the theater only confirmed it.Like Infinity War this film may not be able to sustain itself without the whole concept but as I said at the time about that film I come to repeat here as well. This isn't about that.If after 22 interlaced films you can not understand it, what's the point of saying more about it?Its achievements are numerous. Even with three hours of duration the film never feels heavy, perhaps a little overwhelming for the amount of things happening at the same time but the narrative hardly falls into bumps that make it feel slow or boring.The story is emotional enough especially in the end, even when they reach levels never seen before of fan service, everything feels in its place and I think the most devoted fans will be satisfied.The final battle is spectacular, finally I felt as if I were watching a comic book taking life from the pages to the big screen because the scale and the number of characters make it the most epic battle of the whole saga.But even in spite of its achievements it also has its faults.Despite the lenght you can feel the holes in the story. The visual effects vary too much because in some points it looks pretty good and in others it gets to look very bad. Even the CGI varies in quality because the work is so detailed in Thanos but so simple in Hulk.Even the soundtrack in spite of the quality is not as emotive as that of Infinity War.And for the same reason due to the size of the plot, many characters end up reduced to very small moments in screen.And of the three characters that closed their circle in this film, I must say that the ending of Black Widow was quite bad compared to that of Iron Man and Captain America.Avengers: Endgame closes a cycle and closes it with solidity in a very entertaining show.It's the film that was expected to be and as I said closes a monumental chapter in this franchise in terms of narrative and characters and at the same time laying the foundations for what is to come.Will a new saga of 10 years and more films follow? I don't know, and part of me doubts it, but no matter what happens in the coming years, the achievements of this franchise will undoubtedly be unforgettable for a lot of people.
