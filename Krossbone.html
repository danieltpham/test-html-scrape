            Ah, Avengers: Endgame. The movie that the world was waiting for for about 10 years now? Anyways, let's get straight to the point. This movie is an extremely mixed bag for me. While there's many moments in here that are just breath-taking and badass, there's also a large number of scenes that just had me cringing.First off, let's go over the positives. For anyone who has watched the movie, you know how awesome it was to see Captain America pick up Mjolnir and wail on Thanos. It was a very awe-inspiring scene and was just overall REALLY a fun watch. Similarly to this but with more consequence, when Iron Man acquired the Infinity Stones and snapped Thanos' forces away, that was also just as if not possibly more epic than Capt. America's feat of fighting Thanos with Mjolnir. Was also fun to see Ant-Man knock down a Chitari flying whale with just his giant form, but that's just me fanboying Ant-Man.Another positive is the character arcs that both Capt. America and Iron Man go through over the course of the movie as they re-meet old friends and family as they travel across time trying to re-acquire the Infinity Stones. Now onto the negatives, and oh boy is there a bit to cover.First off, this movie, no matter how many people might tell you otherwise, is FULL of SJW moments very clearly. Let's list them off, shall we?:1. Thor, the white male that he is, has grown to be a lardy alcoholic in this movie that apparently can't even take on base Thanos while Capt. Marvel can effortlessly tank a headbutt from Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet? Nice clear SJWism.2. During the middle of the fight with Thanos, a bunch of the superwomen gather up together and start to wail on Thanos' forces, while all the men're just sitting in the sidelines like a bunch of sissies. This just goes to show the same ol', same ol' trope of "GIRL POWERRRR!" in modern Mary Sue-filled movies.3. Another showing of feminist/SJW propaganda in this movie is Thor just randomly handing off the title of king of Asgard to the random Valkyrie chick we met and saw only a few movies ago. All of that after seeing him become a tub of lard? His character ruined? It's quite pathetic what they did to him, now he just runs around with the Guardians of the Galaxy and'll do who knows what for who knows how long.4. Capt. America handing off the title of, well, Capt. America to a black guy, specifically Falcon, is another showing of stupid disregard for character in exchange for blatant SJW propaganda. Honestly, it's completely out-of-character for Steve to hand out the shield to Falcon instead of Bucky. He very clearly has a much bigger and better relationship with Bucky, so why hand it to Falcon? It's just dumb and completely takes you out of the otherwise surreal experience of seeing Cap as an oldie.I could go on and on about why SJWism is what's ruining this movie, but it has flaws even aside from that. The movie is very uneventful, and very boring as a result. Many a moment, I'd find myself just wanting the movie to be over so I could take a bathroom break. And many of my friends have made the same claims. It's just not as fun to watch as the other movies, minus those few moments Cap and Iron Man had near the end of the film (but we know what happened to both of them, now don't we?).If you just want to finish off the Marvel movies with a bit of a banger, this is the movie for you. It has some badass moments for many fan favs like Cap and Iron Man, and really builds up the fanservice with the final fight.All this considered however, the movie is absolutely LITTERED with SJW garbage that really detracts from the experience for someone with more right-leaning viewpoints. If you're one of those kinda people like me, do or don't see this movie, but most certainly avoid the assuredly SJW phase 4 of the MCU Marvel Studios will be churning out in the not-so-distant future.
