            A little bit of a let down after everything leading up to it. I would have given it a much higher score regardless, if Marvel hadn't put their political agenda's in the film. -They have a scene where they throw in a gay character with absolutely no benefit to the movie, then never seen again. -Then there was Brie Larson at it again. Thank goodness they gave her barely any screen time. Unfortunately that was too much screen time. Every comment she made was condescending, arrogant, and annoying. Terrible Character. Marvel should have definitely used this movie as a way to kill her off from the series. -Then this obsession with empowering all the female characters. In fact they have this one horrible scene where Captain Marvel is trying to get the gauntlet through Thanos' army and only all the female character line up together to protect the gauntlet and back her up. I could totally imagine a "Girl Power" banner in the background. I did a face palm in the theater.-Going along with empowering females, they also make the male characters useless. Hulk is worse in this movie then he was Infinity War, except now they also screwed up Thor. Besides Iron Man, Thor was the only other person who deserved to win this. He sacrificed the most, he lost the most, he suffered the most, yet here they make him a fat, alcoholic, useless, and unmotivated character full of insecurities. He didn't get any redemption nor satisfaction, in fact he gave away what he already had (such as the visions and coming in to save the day in Infinity Wars).-The rest of the male characters where all very submissive and weak around the females while the women acted strong and NEVER once showed any weakness.-They ruin this movie with PC cultural and Feminism once again (not sure why they haven't learned from the Captain Marvel flop). I am no longer going to be seeing Marvel movies in the theaters, they are becoming corrupted by this liberal junk. I go to watch movies to enjoy myself. Not to get political correctness and feminism rammed in my face.
