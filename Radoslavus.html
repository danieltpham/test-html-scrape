            After Infinity War I had high hopes for this one. That's why the dissapoitement struck hard. There are a lot things done wrong with End Game and because of the below I gave it a 4/10:- Thor and Hulk put aside for no reason. They tried to make them some kind of funny characters, but it did not work.- Plot holes, plot holes everywhere. Just for example:(ultimate sacrafice for the soulstone - Hawkey lost his family already; time travel; Ant-Man rescued by rat; Thor took Mjolnir to his timeline; Nebula did not travel back in time, but stayed on the ship and got caught instead; Thor almost killed Thanos when he had the gauntlet with all stones and could not beat him without it; Tony takes all stones away from Thanos, just like that). There are many more, but those are the major ones.- weak, dull and unnecessary jokes - pace and narration problems. It felt somethimes like there was a struggle betwwen two concepts and both ideas were implemented.- forced and unnecessary "strong independent women to the rescue with Spiderman" sceneFor me a Marvel fan it is a huge disappointment, especially after such good Infinity War. End Game felt rushed and produced without a plan and highly inconsistent. A shame though.
