            A very fun and fitting conclusion to a wildly successful saga. Its biggest problem is that it relies heavily on time travel, and while they try to explain it, they constantly break their own rules. Banner explained that when you change the past, it becomes your new present and future. And by returning the stones to their original universe, you cauterise that timeline. So why didn't Captain America staying in the past seriously affect the present? And how did he end up on that bench when you need to be stood on that platform to get back? Why did nobody bat an eyelid when Nebula didn't return when Natasha didn't? And Doctor Strange's 1 in 14,000,000 "plan" relied on the chance that a rat would release Lang 5 years in the future, and countless other unpredictable variables that they had no control over...To put it bluntly, the writing makes almost no sense. However, it succeeded in completing many character arcs, kept it interesting and creative the whole time and the dialogue exceeded the average Marvel movie. It was also accompanied by some nice direction, whether it was snappy editing for comedy, attractive cinematography for the more emotional scenes or to show the scale of the battlefield, in addition to having impressive production, sound design and visual effects.
